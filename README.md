# Questioner

Crowd-source questions for a meetup.

Questioner helps a meetup organizer prioritize questions to be answered during the meetup. After an admin has created a meetup, users can post questions relevant to that meetup. Users are then allowed to upvote or downvote a question thereby allowing the organizer to prioritize the questions based on the votes.

The project is managed using [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) and is available [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2235485)
